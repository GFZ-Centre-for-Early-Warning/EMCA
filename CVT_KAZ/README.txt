README

The data package contains three components: 

1) exposure models in .csv
2) exposure models in .xml - the file is encoded in NRML 0.5 format and is compatible with the GEM openquake processing engine
3) shapefile of the tessellation that aggregates the exposure model. The field "cell_id" is the linkage with the exposure models

NOTE: two exposure models are provided, with prior strength pw 10 and 100. Both models have epsilon=0.001 (see publication indicated in the metadata for details on the modelling process)
